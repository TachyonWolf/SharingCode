This is nice little controller I worked on for a day or two and wanted to share with the Godot community! Enjoy using it!

While you can edit it as much as you like, I gave it a bunch of signles for events so that you can change how it acts without modifing it directly! 

Enjoy! 

No need to credit me or anything, but letting me know what you've done with it would be fun!
