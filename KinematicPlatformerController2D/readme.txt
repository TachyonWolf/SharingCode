This is nice little controller I worked on for a day or two and wanted to share with the Godot community! Enjoy using it!

While you can edit it as much as you like, I gave it a bunch of signles for events so that you can change how it acts without modifing it directly! 
To use it just add it to a KinematicBody2D and add move_left, move_right, and jump buttons to your project!

Enjoy! 

No need to credit me or anything, but letting me know what you've done with it would be fun!
